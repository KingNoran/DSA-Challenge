# Big O Notation: 

Calculation independent on input size = O(1)
loop = O(n)
nested loops = O(n^l) where "l" is the number of loops
Input size reduced by half = O(logn)

Since we have 1 loop and the conditions let us split the array into half each time, we can safely say that the time complexity of this algorithm is 

O(logn)

As the value of n increases, the number of lines to be executed also increases, but not necessarily relativistic.

# Experience:

Just like the Binary Search one, I've been unable to solve this problem. I genuinely didn't know how to do it, even though I knew what to do. I had to look at the solution after an hour of thinking and being just straight up lost.
