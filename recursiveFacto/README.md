# Big O Notation:

Calculation independent on input size = O(1)
loop = O(n)
nested loops = O(n^l) where "l" is the number of loops
Input size reduced by half = O(logn)

Since the recursion only calls the function as many times as "n", we will be using O(n) where the time complexity is linear.
As the value of n increases, the number of lines to be executed also increases.

# Experience

Recursive Fibonacci was harder to think of than this, or maybe it was because I grasped recursion in the last problem that I was able to basically solve this in just two minutes? Not to toot my own horn, of course. I see this as improvement, but I have a long way to go.
