# Big O Notation:

Calculation independent on input size = O(1)
loop = O(n)
nested loops = O(n^l) where "l" is the number of loops
Input size reduced by half = O(logn)

Since we only have 1 loop, we will be using O(n) where the time complexity is linear.
As the value of n increases, the number of lines to be executed also increases.

# Experience

I was a bit stuck as to how exactly I'll make this one more compact since I already knew how to do it. Looking back at it, I realized that I had a habit of overthinking. This experience made me realize that if I know the answer, I should do what I thought of before moving on to better ideas. I must approach the problem one step at a time.
