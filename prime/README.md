# Big O Notation:

In the beginning, I used a nested loops. Since the nested loop has 2 for loops in it, we can use the Quadratic Time Complexity O(n^2) notation.

However, now that I've watched the video, I've discovered a better way of implementing the prime method. Turns out, I can simply just use the modulo operator to check if each preceding number returns a remainder or not when the main number is divided by it. This particular method still uses the Linear Time Space Complexity O(n).

# Experience

I definitely learned something new today. Perhaps the earlier method that I mentioned was far too lazy and complacent of a mindset to have. I must find balance between thinking too much and thinking too less.
