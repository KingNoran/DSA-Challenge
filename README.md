# DSA-Challenge
This is a personal challenge where I try to finish this Data Structures and Algorithms playlist in just a span of a week!

Note: Due to the busy nature of my Finals, I decided to postpone the challenge for a while. I have officially resumed the challenged on June 20, 2024.

[Here is the link of the playlist.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP&si=cUg1VYzHnUF60pzs)

# Documentation

## Day 0

I watched the first 6 videos of the playlist and learned about what an Algorithm really is, as well as how to calculate the Big O notation of an algorithm. At the last video (Math Algorithms), I was given the instructions of the algorithms I'd take the next day.

## Day 1

I watched videos 7 to 11 of the playlist. I learned how to implement the fibonacci function, how to implement a factorial function, how to implement a function that identifies prime numbers, and a function which identifies if a number is a product of a power of two. The last video introduced me to the concept of recursion.
