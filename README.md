This is a personal challenge where I try to finish this Data Structures and Algorithms playlist in just a span of a week!

## Day 0

I watched the first 6 videos of the playlist and learned about what an Algorithm really is, as well as how to calculate the Big O notation of an algorithm. At the last video (Math Algorithms), I was given the instructions of the algorithms I'd take the next day.
