# Big O Notation: 

Calculation independent on input size = O(1)
loop = O(n)
nested loops = O(n^l) where "l" is the number of loops
Input size reduced by half = O(logn)

The Big O notation of this function is O(n^2) since there are two loops (nested) in the function. As the number of equations increase, the number of operations increase squared.

# Experience

This one was relatively easy as it is only an introduction to sorting algorithms. I believe there will be harder challenges than this.
