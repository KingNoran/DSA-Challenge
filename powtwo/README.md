# Big O Notation:

Calculation independent on input size = O(1)
loop = O(n)
nested loops = O(n^l) where "l" is the number of loops
Input size reduced by half = O(logn)

Since we only have 1 while loop, we will be using O(logn) where the time complexity is logarithmic.
As the value of n increases, the number of lines to be executed also increases, but not necessarily the same as the value of n.
