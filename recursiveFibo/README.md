# Big O Notation:

Calculation independent on input size = O(1)
loop = O(n)
nested loops = O(n^l) where "l" is the number of loops
Input size reduced by half = O(logn)

Since the solution is a weird recursion where calling the function once branches two different other function calls, we will be using O(2^n).
As the value of n increases, the number of lines to be executed massively increases, x2 to be exact. This means that recursion is not a good solution to the fibonacci sequence.

# Experience 

I took my time with this one, about 2 hours of just brainstorming as to how I would do recursion. I was unable to grasp the concept at first, but then I searched on google for explanations and examples. As soon as I acquired the necessary knowledge, the answer came to me.
